> **‚ÑπÔ∏è This package is automatically updated from the project root using:**

> - or just `bun run sdk` (regenerates only the SDK)
>
> **Do not edit this package manually. See below for details.**

## Overview

- **Orval-Based SDK:** This package is generated using [Orval](https://orval.dev/), which creates a fully-typed API client from the OpenAPI specification.
- **VITE_API Dependency:** The SDK requires the `VITE_API` environment variable to be set, which should point to the OpenAPI server URL used for code generation and runtime API calls.
    - _Note: `VITE_API` is provided automatically from the project root. You do **not** need to set it manually when using the SDK within the monorepo._
- **Axios & TanStack Query:** The SDK exposes both Axios-based request functions and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) hooks/primitives for flexible data fetching and caching in React applications.

## üö´ Do Not Edit Manually

- **Auto-Generated:** All source files in this package are generated by automated tools (e.g., Orval or OpenAPI generators) based on the backend API specification.
- **No Manual Changes:** Any manual changes to the source code will be overwritten the next time the SDK is regenerated. Please do **not** modify files in this package directly.

## üîÑ Automatic Updates

- **Monorepo Integration:** This package is tightly integrated with the main monorepo. It is updated automatically as part of the monorepo's update pipeline.
- **No Manual Updates Needed:** You do **not** need to update, rebuild, or publish this package manually. The update process is handled by the monorepo's automation scripts.

## Usage

Import the SDK as needed in your application code:

```ts
import { /* API functions */ } from '@rich-road/sdk';
```

Refer to the generated TypeScript types and API functions for usage details. All exports are available from the main entry point (`src/index.ts`).

## Scripts

You can run the following script for type checking (if needed):

```sh
bun run typecheck
```

## Contribution

If you need to update the SDK, **do not edit the code directly**. Instead, update the backend API specification or the code generation configuration, then run the appropriate update pipeline or script as defined in the monorepo.

For more information, see the monorepo documentation or contact the maintainers.
