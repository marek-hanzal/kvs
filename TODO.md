# TODO - Business Features

## 1. Smart TODO System with Notifications

### Core Concept
The TODO system will be the central task management hub that integrates with all other business entities. Unlike traditional TODO apps, this system will have intelligent notification capabilities and deep integration with inventory, transactions, and diary entries.

### Notification-Based TODO Items
Each TODO item will have a notification date and time that triggers when the task is due. The system will support recurring notifications for daily, weekly, or monthly tasks. Priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent) will help users focus on what matters most.

### TODO Item Structure
Every TODO item will contain a title (required), optional description for detailed instructions, a quick note field for memos, due date/time, priority level, and status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled). This comprehensive structure ensures no important details are lost.

### Entity Relations - The Power of Connections
The most powerful feature will be the ability to attach any business entity to a TODO item. For example, a TODO "Take laptop to storage" can be linked to the specific inventory item (laptop), and when completed, automatically create an input transaction. This creates a seamless workflow where actions in one area automatically update related systems.

### Business Workflows
The TODO system will support specific business workflows like storage management. When you create a TODO "Take XXX to storage" and link it to an inventory item, completing the TODO will automatically create an input transaction and update the item's location. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures consistency across the system.

Inventory replenishment TODOs will track when items need restocking, link to supplier information, and automatically create input transactions when completed. Maintenance TODOs will schedule equipment maintenance and track service history with cost tracking.

### Notification Center
A dedicated notification center will display real-time alerts for due TODOs, with options to mark as read/unread and customize notification preferences. Future enhancements could include email and SMS notifications for critical tasks.

### User Interface
The TODO dashboard will show today's tasks, upcoming items, and overdue tasks. Users can view TODOs in calendar format or as a Kanban board for different workflow preferences. Quick actions will allow marking tasks complete, snoozing notifications, and editing TODOs inline.

## 2. Digital Diary with Timeline

### Core Concept
The digital diary will serve as a comprehensive business journal with infinite scroll timeline capabilities. It will be more than just a personal diary - it will be a business intelligence tool that captures decisions, meetings, and progress over time.

### Diary Entry System
Each diary entry will use a rich text editor for detailed content, with automatic date/time stamps. Users can categorize entries with tags and optionally track mood or integrate weather data for context. This creates a rich historical record of business activities.

### Timeline Features
The infinite scroll timeline will present diary entries chronologically, allowing users to smoothly scroll through their business history. Date-based navigation and search capabilities will make it easy to find specific entries or patterns over time.

### Entity Relations
Diary entries can be linked to any business entity - inventory items, transactions, TODO items, or even photos and documents. This creates a comprehensive audit trail where you can see how diary entries relate to actual business activities and decisions.

### Business Integration
The diary will support business-specific workflows like daily business summaries, meeting notes with action items, project progress tracking, customer interaction logs, and financial decision tracking. This transforms the diary from a personal tool into a business intelligence platform.

### Advanced Features
Entry templates will provide structured formats for common business activities like daily summaries, meeting notes, and project updates. Analytics will reveal patterns in entry frequency, tag usage, and business activity trends.

### User Experience
The timeline view will be clean and readable with entry previews and quick edit functionality. Advanced search and filtering will allow users to find entries by date range, tags, or related entities.

## 3. Calendar with Event Tracking

### Core Concept
The Calendar will serve as a visual timeline that displays all business events, activities, and important dates throughout the month. It will provide an at-a-glance view of what's happening in the business, making it easy to plan and track activities.

### Monthly Calendar View
The calendar will display a traditional monthly grid layout showing all days of the current month. Each day will be a tile that can contain multiple events, with visual indicators for different types of activities. The calendar will support navigation between months and years for historical and future planning.

### Event Types and Markers
Different types of events will be visually distinguished with color-coded markers:
- **TODO Items**: Due dates and deadlines with priority-based colors
- **Transactions**: Financial events with income/expense indicators
- **Diary Entries**: Important business notes and decisions
- **Inventory Events**: Stock movements, maintenance schedules, reorder dates
- **Custom Events**: User-defined events like meetings, appointments, or reminders

### Event Display
Each day tile will show a summary of events with:
- Event count indicator (e.g., "3 events")
- Color-coded dots for different event types
- Hover tooltips showing event previews
- Click-to-expand functionality for detailed view

### Quick Event Creation
The calendar will support quick event creation directly from the calendar view:
- Click on any day to add a new event
- Drag and drop events between dates
- Quick TODO creation with due dates
- Direct transaction entry for financial events

### Business Intelligence
The calendar will provide insights into business patterns:
- Busiest days and weeks
- Event type distribution
- Completion rates for scheduled activities
- Historical trends and seasonal patterns

### Integration with Other Modules
The calendar will automatically pull events from all other business modules:
- TODO due dates and completions
- Transaction dates and financial milestones
- Diary entry timestamps
- Inventory movement dates
- Maintenance schedules

### User Experience
The calendar interface will be clean and intuitive with:
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Quick navigation between months
- Today highlighting and current time indicators
- Print-friendly views for physical planning
- Export capabilities for external calendar applications

## 4. Enhanced Inventory Management

### Smart Inventory Features
The inventory system will automatically generate TODO items based on business rules. Low stock alerts will notify when items need reordering, expiry date reminders will prevent waste, and maintenance schedules will ensure equipment stays operational.

Inventory analytics will provide insights into usage patterns, stock turnover rates, cost analysis, and demand forecasting. This data-driven approach will help optimize inventory levels and reduce costs.

### Location Management
Multi-location support will track items across different storage areas, rooms, or facilities. Location-based TODO items will help manage transfers between locations, and the system will maintain a complete audit trail of item movements.

---

## 5. Financial Tracking Enhancements

### Transaction Categories
A comprehensive categorization system will organize income and expenses into meaningful categories, enabling budget tracking and category-based reporting. Financial goals can be set and tracked against actual performance.

### Business Intelligence
Financial analytics will provide cash flow analysis, profit/loss tracking, expense categorization, and financial forecasting. This will give users deep insights into their business financial health and help with strategic decision-making.

---

## 6. Integration Features

### Cross-Entity Relations
A universal linking system will allow any entity to be connected to any other entity. This creates a web of relationships that can be analyzed for impact assessment and dependency management. For example, completing a TODO might affect inventory levels, create a transaction, and update a diary entry.

### Workflow Automation
Automated workflows will reduce manual work by triggering actions based on events. TODO completion might automatically create transactions, update statuses, or send notifications. This creates a self-managing system that reduces errors and increases efficiency.

---

## 7. Mobile and Accessibility

### Mobile Features
The application will be fully mobile-responsive with touch-friendly interfaces and offline capability. Push notifications will keep users informed even when not actively using the system, and mobile-specific workflows will optimize the experience for on-the-go business management.

### Accessibility
Full accessibility compliance will ensure the application is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities. Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast mode, and voice input support will make the system inclusive and user-friendly.

## 8. Data Management

### Backup and Sync
Robust data protection will include automatic backups, data export/import capabilities, version history, and data recovery options. This ensures business data is always safe and recoverable.

### Performance
The system will be optimized for performance with database optimization, caching strategies, lazy loading, and performance monitoring. This ensures the application remains fast and responsive even as data grows.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

### AI Integration
Smart suggestions will use artificial intelligence to recommend TODO items based on patterns, auto-categorize transactions, provide predictive analytics, and process natural language input. This will make the system increasingly intelligent and user-friendly.

### External Integrations
Third-party service integrations will connect the system to calendars, email, cloud storage, and provide APIs for external tools. This will create a connected ecosystem that works with existing business tools and workflows.

### Advanced Reporting
Comprehensive reporting capabilities will include a custom report builder, scheduled reports, data visualization, and export capabilities. This will provide the insights needed for strategic business decisions and compliance requirements.

## Implementation Strategy

The development approach will focus on building these features incrementally, starting with the core TODO and diary systems, then adding entity relations, and finally implementing advanced features like AI integration and external services. Each feature will be designed to work independently while providing maximum value when used together.

The goal is to create a unified business management platform that feels like a natural extension of how users think about and manage their business, rather than a collection of separate tools that require manual coordination.
